<h2>What are Linked Lists?</h2>

Let us begin with the [*Oxford Language Dictionary* defintion for Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=stack+definition&rlz=1C1JZAP_esUS929US929&oq=stack+definition&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i20i263i512j0i512l7j0i20i263i512.2875j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8): 

"[transitive] to make a physical or electronic connection between one object, machine, place, etc. and another synonym **connect.**"

- Example 1.
**"Linked Toy Train Carts"**

- Example 2.
**"A link of people holding hands"**
    - *Keep both examples in mind as you read through*.


 *Linked Lists* for Software are no different from the day-to-day noun we use for *stack*. The unique difference is the usage it has in the aspect of Software creation:

 Stacks in programming Software are a set of objects added above eachother in sequential order and can be stored into different formats. With Python Programming Language, Stacks are used for *lists, enqueue, and dequeue*. You can only get rid of an object by removing the last object you added into the list.

<h2>Why are they important?</h2>

Many programs we use today require the usage of Linked Lists so we can keep track of data locations in memory.


<h2>When do we use them?</h2>

Pause for a moment and think of Software that allows you use **Linked Lists**. Here are two common situations:

**SITUATION A:**
-  Define.

    1. **X**: 
    2. **X**: 
    3.  **X**: 


**SITUATION B:**

- Define.
    1. **X**:

    2. **X**: 


<h2> O - Notation for Linked Lists Operations </h2>

We have been using **Linked Lists Operations** as we have learned about Linked Lists. It is good for you to be able to identify **Linked List Operations** in order to determine their Algorithmic Efficiency when debugging or building different types of Software: 

The common **O - Notation** Linked Lists Operations are the following:

- **define**: *x*
    
- **define**: *x*
    
- **define**: *x.*
    
- **define**: *x*
- **REPLACE IMAGE BELOW TO O NOTATION FOR LINKED LISTS**: *x*
