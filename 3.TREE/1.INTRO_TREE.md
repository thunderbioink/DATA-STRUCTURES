<h2>What are Trees?</h2>

You might be thinking that these trees are the coolest thing in the world and have nothing to do with Programming Data Structures. However, what are things all physical trees have in common with Programming? Let us take a closer look:

*Trees* are similar to *Linked Lists*, but the difference from these Data Structures is that, *Trees*, similar to a normal tree, have leafs, also known as *Nodes*, and these can connect to more than one *Node* or *Leaf*, thanks to *branches*, which are called *Pointers*. As a tree grows from the *root* Node, then you can create a *subtree*, that will become a *Parent* Node.

Think of Family History Trees: Root is Grandmother, Parents come from Grandparents, Children come from Parents, and Children can be leafs.

<h2>Why are they important?</h2>

Trees in Data Structures can help us locate, change, remove, data in many efficient ways using mutiple operators that can help our software run faster.

<h2>When do we use them?</h2>

Pause for a moment, and think of different programs that can use **Trees**. Here is a common situation:

**SITUATION A:**

- Programs, Web Apps, and Search engines are able to use Trees to locate specific data:
    1. Music Applications: Going back to our Music Applications example, you can organize data alphabetically, delete a song from a playlist or your music library, add a song to your music library, you can get the amount of time all the tracks are in total and the total time the playlist will take to play. You can even find songs based on common letters found in the Artist, Song, Album, or Genre:

        1.  **Type in search**:

        2.  **Observe suggestions**: They can be consdiered possible parent, chil, or leaf nodes.

        3. **RESULTS IN ARTIST FOR HER**: Your Parent is *her*, your children are any artist with those letters or combo, and the leafs are the songs pertaining to each artist.

<h2> O - Notation for Common Operations </h2>

Common *O - Notation* Tree Operations are the following:

- **insert(x)/remove(x):** O(log n) efficiency.
- **find node, find ize of Node Class:** O(log n) efficiency, and O(n) efficiency respectively.
- **Return boolean TRUE if Node value is == 0**:O(n) efficiency.

- **Display information from smallest to largest/vice versa:** 
- **Get height of Tree**:
