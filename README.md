# WELCOME

Hello World! Learning how to program is always an exciting journey. In this journey, you will eventually hit the intimidating yet very important topic of **Data Structures**. 

After learning them and how to incorporate them in your programs, you will love them, and realize how much your programming and problem solving skils have increased.

**PRE-REQUISITES**:
Prior to jumping into Data Structures, it's important you have an understanding of basic python programming concepts such as variables, functions, classes, and O-Notation. If you need to review these concepts, check the pre-requisite materials at the [bottom of this page.](#pre-requisite-websites)

**Task:** Learn three Data Structures and implement them in your programing.

**Purpose:** To become a better versed programmer, using Data Structures.

In this repository we will cover three different Data Structures:

1. **STACKS:** 
    - *What* are *Stacks*, *why* they are important, and *when* they can be used.
    - Solved example to explain how *Stacks* are implemented.
    - A second example for you to solve. A solution will be provided.

2. **LINKED LISTS:**
    - *What* are *Linked Lists*, *why* they are important, and *when* they can be used.
    - Solved example to explain how *Linked Lists* are implemented.
    - A second example for you to solve. A solution will be provided.

3. **TREES:**
    - *What* are *Trees*, *why* they are important, and *when* they can be used.
    - Solved example to explain how *Trees* are implemented.
    - A second example for you to solve. A solution will be provided.
